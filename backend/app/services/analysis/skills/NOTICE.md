# Analysis Skill third-party notices

Most built-in analysis skills are original, project-specific rewrites. The screenplay source modules listed below vendor exact upstream Markdown files and compile named sections into the selected skill snapshot. No upstream scripts, MCP definitions, plugins, network calls, file writes, or sub-agent workflows execute in the analysis worker.

- License: MIT; copyright 2026 wangzhang-wu.
- Local use: the screenplay and director-breakdown rules independently express evidence-based scene function, observable blocking, shot purpose, edit relationships, continuity anchors, and actionable production thinking.

Product-specific prompt templates, negative prompts, generation modes, platform routing, and execution workflows were excluded.

## cutmap

- License: MIT; copyright 2026 sammyteng.
- Local use: the local article skill independently adopts a thesis-first outline, mobile-readable short paragraphs, editorial evidence, and a pre-publication checklist. Categorical moderation claims, hard-coded credentials and paths, browser injection, external research, account-specific style, publishing commands, and automatic calls to other skills were explicitly excluded.

## Scene Scribe (review only; no adoption)

- Local use: the project independently implements conflict, scene function, causal progression, dialogue subtext/voice, and character choice/change as screenplay diagnostics. Deno scripts, session persistence, interactive workflows, examples, and cross-Skill orchestration were excluded.

## translate-book

- Source: https://github.com/deusyu/translate-book
- Reviewed commit: `5d07e733fa9318ff9c718085191c0c2243f51383`

- Reviewed commit: `994ee7514c64a9ec4980eeabef789b5e10ea28be`
- License: MIT; copyright 2026 oxbshw.
- Local use: the opening-hook and continuity-quality reviews independently adopt bounded observation, visible change and on-screen-text review, evidence-backed creator feedback, and an explicit distinction between observation, risk and verified outcomes. The upstream runtime, scoring formulas, CLI, MCP, REST API, capture/index stores, OCR, ASR, model integrations, scripts, examples, tests, and assets were excluded.

## drama-skills

- Source: https://github.com/zenstory-ai/drama-skills
- Reviewed commit: `3ab6b8550bbccef71001d2187e2b2ac9a74ab917`

## drama-skills screenplay story review (2026-09-24)

- Source: https://github.com/zenstory-ai/drama-skills/tree/b71cb3ca9343eaf6c0375725ccc9261a4e79021e/skills/short-drama-review
- Reviewed commit: `b71cb3ca9343eaf6c0375725ccc9261a4e79021e`.
- License: MIT; copyright 2026 drama-skills contributors.
- Local use: `screenplay-analysis`, `screenplay-drama-review`, `screenplay-character-review`, `screenplay-scene-review`, `screenplay-dialogue-review`, and `screenplay-continuity-review` compile named sections directly from vendored upstream `review-method.md`, `rubric-story-script.md`, and `anti-template-repair.md`. The upstream `SKILL.md` is retained for provenance. File publication, scripts, examples, other media rubrics, and agent workflow are not executed.

## screenwriting-skills screenplay story review (2026-09-24)

- Source: https://github.com/jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills/tree/357d1348ccaa1ab75f2f51ef7c90a7f00a686c76/plugins/screenwriting/skills
- Reviewed commit: `357d1348ccaa1ab75f2f51ef7c90a7f00a686c76`.
- License: MIT; copyright 2026 Terry Jia.
- Local use: `screenplay-analysis`, `screenplay-character-review`, `screenplay-scene-review`, `screenplay-dialogue-review`, and `screenplay-structure-review` compile named diagnostic sections directly from the four vendored upstream `SKILL.md` files. Their fixed page counts, required beat shapes, authoring exercises, examples, and other Skill links are reference material, not product acceptance criteria or executable workflow.

Both repositories' original MIT licenses are included beside their vendored files. `modules.py` pins each source file SHA-256, and `loader.py` embeds only explicitly named sections in each task's immutable instruction snapshot. A source change requires a deliberate hash and section review; no runtime GitHub fetch occurs.

## video-shotcraft

- Source: https://github.com/Vincentwei1021/video-shotcraft
- Reviewed commit: `b0cb89173c9278042db78c3fb9c339814966f874`
- License: Apache-2.0; copyright 2026 Wei Yihao.
- Local use: the opening-hook review independently emphasizes reviewing rendered evidence before delivery, legible on-screen text, a clear initial subject, purposeful visual progression, and shot-specific handoff checks. Upstream wording, shot cards, recipes, demos, media, Remotion templates, source code, gallery, generation workflow, sound library, examples, and assets were excluded.

Updating any reviewed commit requires a fresh license and prompt-injection review, static fixtures, and real-provider E2E before release.
